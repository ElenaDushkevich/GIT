        Checklist structure

 Checklist is defined as a list of tasks that need to be completed. A checklist organizes items in a systematic manner and provides an overview of what tasks we need to accomplish
 Checklists are arranged very simply. Any of them contains a list of blocks, sections, pages, and other elements that should be tested
 One item = one check
 Completed items are marked with statuses, for example: “Passed”, “Failed”, “Blocked”, “Skipped”, “Not run”
